  <h1>Everything</h1>
  <p>Everything manages your possessions and wishes from your the pocket of your pants.</p>
  <p>The need for Everything struck me when I had to get on my own feet again. With that came
      a lot of stuff: a pan with a lifelong guarantee, many receipts from IKEA. My wish to set
      out on an adventure with a minimal outfit was also born. Which gear is good? What supplements
      other things? How do I share my experiences?</p>
