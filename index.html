                A user manual comes in a dozen languages, 11 of which aren't mine. <em>This is just a
                huge waste of paper and energy</em>. And whenever you actually need the manual, it is
                nowhere to be found.

                Warranty information and receipts are important, but easily misplaced. This can lead
                to costly mistakes. That shoebox, the binder or the trashcan just doesn't cut it.

It just isn't easy to organize and keep track of my possessions. Where did I store the skates? What should we bring on the camping trip? This would also be helpful for insurance.

꤀ This is a problem worth solving


It is hard and cumbersome to reach the manufacturer for support. Where to get spare parts or accessories, what happens when something breaks? And how will they reach you if there is a safety issue with my cooker or the children's toys.

꤀ This is a problem worth solving


I often don't know or forgot what to ask for my birthday. Although every now and then I come across things that I need or want. Likewise it is hard to come up with presents for other people.

꤀ This is a problem worth solving


Sharing (borrowing, lending & renting) things seems like a good idea as owning less is both environmentally and economically friendly. Some problems keep me from this: Who has my stuff and when is it due? How do I know it is still in good condition after use? Where can I find or offer my things for rent?

꤀ This is a problem worth solving


Several websites like Marktplaats and eBay help you find secondhand goods, but they do not offer the reliability in identity and payment like Ticketswap and Airbnb do.
